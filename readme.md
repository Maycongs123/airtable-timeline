# Gantt Timeline Component

- What I Like About My Implementation:
The Gantt chart timeline view is an excellent way to visualize items with nearby dates. It allows for interactive features like dragging items to adjust their dates, as well as dragging the edges to expand or reduce the range of a task. Additionally, double-clicking an item enables the user to change its name, making it very user-friendly and flexible.

-  What I Would Change if I Were Going to Do It Again:
If I were to do it again, I would focus on making the visualization more compact. I would also work on improving the fluidity of the timeline and the dragging interactions for both the timeline and the individual items, to make the user experience more seamless.

- How I Made My Design Decisions:
For inspiration, I turned to Dribbble, a site that I admire for its vast collection of design and UI/UX references. To build this component, I first focused on the layout and then progressively built the logic behind each feature. I started with the basics: how to edit an item's name, how to drag an item to change its date, and how to resize items by holding the edges to modify their timeline range.

- How I Would Test This if I Had More Time:
If I had more time, I would add filtering options for year, month, and week. I would also make the layout responsive for mobile devices to ensure a smooth experience across all screen sizes. Additionally, I would implement zoom in and zoom out functionality for better navigation and visualization of the timeline. I did attempt to implement this feature but unfortunately ran out of time.
